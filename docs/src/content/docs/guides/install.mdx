Eventually, Vorpal will have an installation script that will handle this for
you! Keep an eye on our GitHub

This guide will walk you through installing Vorpal.

## Setting up the `/var/lib/vorpal` directory

Vorpal requires that you have a directory (`/var/lib/vorpal`) created ahead of
time with a specific structure so it can persist built binaries and build
sources to the disk.

You can set this filesystem structure up with three simple commands (though
you'll need root, so either `sudo su` beforehand or prefix each command with
`sudo`!)

```shell
mkdir -pv /var/lib/vorpal/{key,sandbox,store}
mkdir -pv /var/lib/vorpal/store/artifact/{alias,archive,config,output}
chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /var/lib/vorpal
```

## Install

Now you've correctly set up your `/var/lib/vorpal` directory, you can install
the Vorpal binary itself and set up the cryptographic keys used for builds.

### From a binary release

Vorpal distributes a nightly binary release over on GitHub. To install it to
`/usr/local/bin`, you can run the following:

```bash
export VORPAL_VERSION="nightly"
export VORPAL_ARCH="x86_64" # either x86_64 or aarch64
export VORPAL_PLATFORM="linux" # either linux or darwin
curl -L "https://github.com/ALT-F4-LLC/vorpal/releases/download/$VORPAL_VERSION/vorpal-${VORPAL_ARCH}-${VORPAL_PLATFORM}.tar.gz" -o /tmp/vorpal.tar.gz
tar -xf /tmp/vorpal.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
rm vorpal.tar.gz
```

### From source

TODO

## Post-install

Now you've installed Vorpal, the last step to perform is to create some
cryptographic keys to sign your artifacts & sources with. **This is required.**
If you do not run this, you will not be able to use the tool.

To create the keys, just run the following:

```bash
vorpal system keys generate
```

That's it! You're ready to manage your software lifecycle with Vorpal.
