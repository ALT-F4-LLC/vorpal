## Features

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Reproducible builds" icon="puzzle">

    reproducible from the get-go. Be rid of pesky _works on my machine!_
    problems.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Ship your code" icon="rocket">

    own securely self-hosted one.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Secrets supported!" icon="setting">
		Vorpal comes with powerful build-time secrets injection out of the box. Use
    the official implementation or a third-party one for whatever secrets
    platform you use.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Verify everything" icon="approve-check-circle">
